/// Spooky Happenings in Miner Town! ///
- Robert Hensley (CPE 203)

I. Event Triggered

    A supernatural force is spawning 3x3 graveyards from the ground! With
    a left click of a button, the background of the clicked tile and it's adjacent
    manhattan/diagonal neighbors are turned into the following background images
        1. Dirt (70%)
        2. Graves (20%)
        3. Pumpkins (8.5%)
        4. Spooky Trees (2.5%; RARE!)

II. Effects of the Events

    Horrifyingly, the miners of the town are being turned into zombies!
    Upon a click, all Miners (full and not full) in the targeted area
    and it's manhattan/diagonal neighbors turn into a MinerZombie!
    - ActionPeriods and Animation Periods will be inhereted from
      the original non-infected miner

III. Zombie Actions

    The zombies will infect other Miners (full and not full) that they target! Yikes!
    (ActionPeriod/Animation Periods will also be inhereted from non-infected miner)

    Fortunately OreBlobs will destroy the infected Miners with their quake voodoo magic.
    (They felt bad about destroying the precious Vein the Miners harvested Ore from)
    - OreBlobs will destroy whichever entity is closest to them (Veins or MinerZombies)

    Additionally, when no Vein is present on the map, Miners will head home
    (to the BlackSmiths) because it's too spooky outside!

IV. Another Evil Entity

    If you thought a zombie outbreak wasn't bad enough, there's an even worse entity
    lurking in the graveyard... the notorious PumpkinMan. Although the PumpkinMan is
    slow, he targets any moving entity and obliterates them with his quake magic!
    Beware of large clumps of entities; that is where he is known to strike!

    - Action Period: 800
    - Targets include:
        1. OreBlobs
        2. Miners (Full/NotFull)
        3. Zombies
